# Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Setup

User Registration & Authentication: Use NextAuth.js or a similar library to set up user login, registration, and session management.
Dashboard Creation: Design a simple, clean dashboard where users can add and view their cars, showing high-level stats like upcoming maintenance and recent logs.
Database Structure: Set up MongoDB to store user info, car details, and maintenance history. Each car entry could have fields for make, model, year, mileage, etc.

## Phase 2: Key Features

Maintenance Scheduler: Allow users to add maintenance tasks with optional recurrence (like every 5,000 miles or every 6 months).
Reminders: Implement email reminders using a service like SendGrid or Mailgun to notify users of upcoming tasks.
History Tracking: Add functionality for users to log maintenance details (work done, date, mileage) to create a full history for each car.

## Phase 3: Enhancements

Service Locator: Use a third-party API (like Google Maps) to locate nearby service centers based on the user’s location.
Analytics Dashboard: Provide users with insights on their car’s health based on maintenance history, such as frequency of oil changes or any overdue tasks.
Mobile Optimization: Since many users might access it on the go, optimize for mobile views with Tailwind’s responsive utilities.

## Phase 4: Stretch Goals

Community & Social Features: Allow users to share their maintenance logs, connect with others with similar car models, or recommend local service providers.
Car-Specific Reminders: Use an API for car specs (like Edmunds or CarMD) to pull specific maintenance requirements based on make and model.
This project is ideal for showcasing your skills in front-end, backend, and UI/UX design. Plus, it’s a real-world app that’s easy for interviewers to relate to.
